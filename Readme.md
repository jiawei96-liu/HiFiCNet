Ensuring reliable operation of cloud networks is critical for cloud service providers to guarantee quality of service for tenants. A promising solution is to design a high-fidelity cloud network validation platform that proactively validates the correctness of all operations before implementing changes to the production network. However, the tight coupling between physical and virtual networks in the cloud poses challenges to achieving high-fidelity cloud network validation. Existing network validation platforms focus primarily on traditional physical networks, while ignoring virtual network validation. Regrettably, neglecting the combined validation of physical and virtual networks will result in inaccurate evaluations. To bridge this gap, we present HifiCNet, a high-fidelity platform that concurrently validates both physical and virtual networks. HifiCNet designs an orchestrator to elegantly coordinate the interaction between physical and virtual networks in the cloud and innovatively adopts an emulator-simulator hybrid architecture to ensure high fidelity and scalability for cloud network validation. Through extensive evaluation based on real topologies and traffic traces, we show that HifiCNet enables high-fidelity validation of cloud network configurations, services, and exceptions. Notably, HifiCNet can leverage 38 servers to establish a physical network comprising 10k hosts, as well as a virtual network consisting of 200k virtual machines.
