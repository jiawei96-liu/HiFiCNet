# Standard fattree topology:
# Fat tree is a switch centric topology. Support to expand the number of paths while expanding horizontally; All switches are common devices with the same number of ports, which reduces the network construction cost.
# Specifically, the fattree structure is divided into three layers: core layer (core switch), aggregation layer (aggregation switch) and access layer (edge switch). A K-ary fattree can be summarized into five features:
# 1. Each switch has K ports;
# 2. The core layer is the top layer, with a total of (K/2) ^2 switches;
# 3. There are K pods in total, and each pod is composed of K switches. The aggregation layer and access layer account for K/2 switches respectively;
# 4. Each switch in the access layer can accommodate K/2 servers. thus, the K-ary fattree has a total of K pods, each pod can accommodate K*K/4 servers, and all pods can accommodate K*K*K/4 servers;
# 5. There are K paths between any two pods.
# In other words, there are (K/2)^2+K^2 switches and (K^3)/4 servers in the K-ary fattree topology
# The relationship between the value of K in the fattree topology and the number of switches and servers is summarized as follows:
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Value of K            |   2   |   4   |   6   |   8   |   10  |   12  |   14  |   16  |   32  |   64
# Number of switches    |   5   |   20  |   45  |   80  |   125 |   180 |   245 |   320 |   1280|   5120
# Number of servers     |   2   |   16  |   54  |   128 |   250 |   432 |   686 |   1024|   8192|   65536
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Custom fattree topology:
# To enable this script to support a larger topology, we add an additional parameter S to control the number of servers that each edge switch can connect to.
# In this case, there are (K/2)^2+K^2 switches and (K/2)*K*S servers in the K-ary custom topology (the valus of S in standard fattree topology is K//2).
# The relationship between the value of K, the value of S and the number of switches and servers is summarized as follows:
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Value of K            |   2   |   4   |   6   |   8   |   10  |   12  |   14  |   16  |   32  |   64
# Number of switches    |   5   |   20  |   45  |   80  |   125 |   180 |   245 |   320 |   1280|   5120
# Number of servers     |   2S  |   8S  |   18S |   32S |   50S |   72S |   98S |   128S|   512S|   2048S
